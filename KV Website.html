                <p><b><i>The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), or Central Schools,</i></b> is a system of education in India that was <em>established in 1965</em> under the <u>Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD)</u>. The original goal of the KVS was to educate the children of Indian defense personnel who are often stationed in remote locations. The schools were later expanded to include children of all central government employees, and the system was intended to ensure that students would not face educational disadvantages if their parents were transferred. The KVS has since become known as a center of excellence in school education, promoting national integration and academic excellence. </p>
